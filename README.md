# Arduino light suit

An arduino nano based light dance dress used for our college arts fest. The suit is lined with different segments of single colour led strips. These strips are controlled by an arduino digital output coupled with transistor.

Edit [orginal/lightdancefunctions.ino](https://github.com/1061999/Arduino_light_suit/blob/master/orginal/lightdancefunctions.ino) to create your own patterns according to the steps and music.
